# DelphiDabbler Archives

`ddab-archive` is where I keep archives of old, retired, programs and library code that were never maintained using Git.

Some of the code was maintained in Subversion, and some was never developed using a CVS at all.

_All the projects in this organisation are archived and are no longer being developed._
