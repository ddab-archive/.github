# DelphiDabbler Archives

`ddab-archive` is where I keep archives of old, retired, programs and library code that were never maintained using Git.

Some of the code was maintained in Subversion, and some was never developed using a CVS at all.

_All the projects in this organisation are archived and are no longer being developed._

To see my active projects please visit one or more of:

* [delphidabbler](https://github.com/delphidabbler) - my main account
* [ddablib](https://github.com/ddablib) - the DDabLib library of Delphi code
* [cahamo](https://github.com/cahamo) - my microcontroller project code

Here's a list of all the archived projects stored here:
