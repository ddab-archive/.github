# ‚õî No Contributions Possible ‚õî

The `ddab-archive` organisation is where projects come to die!

It's sole purpose is to archive mothballed delphidabbler projects that never previously had a home on GitHub.

Everything here is archived and read-only, so contributions aren't possible.

Of course, you're free to fork the repos and do what you want with them, within the terms of the licenses.

Having explained that, do note that contributions are welcome to my other projects. Please check out:

* [delphidabbler](https://github.com/delphidabbler) - my main account
* [ddablib](https://github.com/ddablib) - the DDabLib library of Delphi code
* [cahamo](https://github.com/cahamo) - my microcontroller project code

Thanks üëç
